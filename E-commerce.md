# Assignment 4: E-Commerce Site

© Caroline Barrière, University of Ottawa

---

## GOALS

This fourth assignment is a **group assignment**. It is meant to give you hands-on experience toward the development of a small e-commerce site and to put in application different concepts seen during:

- **Module 5** – System Design
- **Module 6** – Verbal Communication

You can choose any e-commerce that you wish (e.g., selling clothing, furniture, or anything that can be sold). There are technical requirements for your e-commerce site, so make sure your selection allows you to meet these requirements.

By carrying out this assignment, you will:

- Reflect on the notion of **System Image** and the compatibility of knowledge organization between the system and the user
- Explore **visual design** in relation to appropriate layouts for different interactive processes
- Learn how to implement a **faceted search**
- Reflect on **language** in relation to various communicative goals
- Continue expanding your **JavaScript development skills**

## REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Use the Same Group as Assignment 3

- Your group is already registered in Brightspace.
- If you need to change group, contact a TA during a lab session.
- **Do not remove yourself from a group**; grades are assigned to groups.

### 2. Explore E-Commerce Sites and Choose Your Domain

- Explore e-commerce sites (e.g., electronics, clothing, groceries, furniture).
- Find at least **two resources** that inspire your site.
- Decide what you will sell, to whom, and give your e-commerce a name.

### 3. Reflect / Design

#### (A) System Design

Your site must include **three interactive processes**:

1. **Follow Instructions Process**  
   For a user to buy an item, with steps such as: put in cart, enter personal info, pay, get confirmation.

2. **Exploring in the Divergent/Convergent Process**  
   Using a **faceted search**. Think of features users would want to search on (e.g., size, color, material).

3. **Communicate Process**  
   A survey to be performed after visiting or buying.

#### (B) Verbal Communication

Your site must use language thoughtfully.

- **Writer/Reader Model**: Decide how the site presents itself and talks to users.
- **Intention/Purpose**: Include at least three types of communication purpose:
  - **Incite to action**: Promotional language (deals, rebates, etc.)
  - **Inform**: Informative tone for shopping and understanding items.
  - **Engage in a connection**: Positive, engaging language to encourage survey completion.

### 4. Implement Your E-Commerce Site as a High-Fidelity Prototype

- **Use a JavaScript framework** (e.g., React)
- **Organization, input, and navigation patterns** should facilitate browsing and buying.
- **Interactivity**: Users must be able to browse, buy, and fill in the survey.
  - Product exploration must be functional with a faceted search.
  - Payment form required (no need to link to payment platform).
  - Survey can be simple (comment/evaluate experience).
- **Accessible through your portfolio** (from Assignment 1)
- **Interactive Processes and System Image**:
  - The 3 required processes should be clearly found.
  - The "follow instructions" process should show the user's step and progress.
  - The "communicate process" must be a short survey.
  - The "explore process" must be a well-thought-out, functional faceted search.

#### (B) Verbal Communication

- **Writer/Reader model** should be clear and consistent.
- The 3 communicative purposes should be recognizable (incite to action, inform, engage in a connection).

#### Visual Design Principles

- Use a **color theme** and be consistent
- Use **typography** to attract attention
- Consider **layout** and use of negative space
- Apply principles of **contrast, scale, balance, visual hierarchy**
- Use **Gestalt Principles** (similarity, continuity, closure, figure/ground, etc.)
- Ensure synergy between **visual and verbal communication**

### 5. Host Your High-Fidelity Prototype

- Host your prototype online (Netlify recommended, or GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc.)
- The website must remain **anonymous** (no team member names in the URL).
- Each member must link their portfolio to the prototype.
- Both portfolio and e-commerce site must be **publicly accessible** (or password protected with password in your report).
- The TA must be able to test your UI without contacting you.

### 6. Link Your Portfolios to Your High-Fidelity Prototype

- Each group member must link their portfolio to the e-commerce prototype.
- Provide links to your portfolios in your report.

### 7. Write a Short Report Describing Your Design Process and Choices

Your report should include:

1. **Designers**: Group number, names, student numbers
2. **E-Commerce Goal**:
   - Name and type of e-commerce you built
   - Links to inspiration sites and how they inspired you
3. **Reflection / Design**:
   - (A) **Interactive process / System Image design**:
     - For the follow instruction process: How do you provide feedback on steps?
     - For the explore process: What filters are in your faceted search?
     - For the communicate process: How is the survey not intrusive and engaging?
   - (B) **Verbal communication design**:
     - What is your Writer/Reader model? How do you ensure consistency?
     - Examples of words and sentence types for the 3 communicative purposes
4. **High-Fidelity Prototype**:
   - Explain your visual design choices
   - Link to your portfolios (both, if in pairs)
5. **Code**: Link to the group’s GitHub
6. **Generative AI Acknowledgement**:  
   - Describe the role of generative AI in your prototype and report
   - List GenAI tools used and your interactions with them
